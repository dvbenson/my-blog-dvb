# NextAuth Setup

- npm i next-auth
- create api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
- this is the route that next-auth will use to handle authentication from providers, i.e. Google, GitHub etc. Whomever you choose to use.
- shared session state, creating a sessionprovider wrapper for layout page
- create your login button system using nextauth hooks
- create your api/auth/[...nextauth]/callback.ts??
- think about what routes or pages are protected etc.
